### There notes are based on personal conversations with our Rabbi and are not necessarily applicable to everyone.  Do not treat this as halachic advice without first consulting your Rabbi.

## Unprocessed foods
* Raw nuts that do not require ceertification year-round do not require it on Pesach.
* When buying fresh fruits and vegetables that "may have been treated with food grade vegetable or shellac wax resin", it is enough to wash them very well, but we prefer to peel them if they were purchased on Pesach itself.
* Fresh Romaine hearts would have some indication on the package if they were sprayed with anything.  Triple-washed ones should be avoided for Pesach unless it can be ascertained that what was used to spray them contained no hametz.
