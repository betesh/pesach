### There notes are based on personal conversations with our Rabbi and are not necessarily applicable to everyone.  Do not treat this as halachic advice without first consulting your Rabbi.

## Cosmetics
* Our Rabbi recommends using only toothpaste that is specifically approved for Pesach.  We prefer to be strict with Mouthwash too, though he considers it inedible and therefore allows any.

* We put away lipstick, chapstick, toothpaste, mouthwash and floss that wasn't approved.  Any hametz in it may have been sold, depending on the wording of the contract.

* Star-K and JSOR have good cosmetics lists
