* Where to buy stuff:
  * A-to-Z Savings:
    * 4.1 oz. glass stemware
    * Shabbat sponges
    * 72" x 25" countertop covers

* Consumable supplies to buy for next year:
  * Plasticware, plates, bowls, cups
  * Plastic table cloth covers
  * Hot cups
  * 20" x 12" disposable aluminum pan cover (blech, covers half the stove)
  * 17" x 14" aluminum sheet (Seder plate - -labelled each area before YT.  Longer would be better but haven't found it yet)

* Things we put away for next year:
  * Shot cups
  * Unflavored dental floss and pluckers
  * Turkish coffee
  * Pesach-themed napkins
  * Washing cup

* Matza:
  * Bought 4.4 lbs. Machpud (Sharaby), 3 lb. Lakewood (1 speltm 1 whole wheat, 1 regular), 2 lb. machine, 1 lb. egg
  * Was enough for 2 adults + 3 kids for all YT meals, plus guests for 4 meals (we could have done with 1 lb. less of Lakewood, or 1 more of Lakewood and 2 less of soft)
  * There was no Shabbat Hol Hamoed.
  * Bought 2 lb. matza meal
  * Used only Shumra for entire Pesach, inclusing Matza meal

* Rice:
  * Check at last 12 cups next year.

* Bought new tupperware and plastic mixing bowls (our year-round glass mixing bowls were difficult to clean.)
* Used dishwasher as a drying rack only.
* Didn't cover glass table during Chol Hamo'ed.  Kept a folding table open in living room all week for computer, etc.
* Covered countertops with corrugated countertop covers.  Bought 4 of them.  For next year, make sure to also cover vertical part of counter and fridge shelves with heavy-duty alimunim foil.
* Kashered Shabbat silverware + weekday serving silverware + 1 kiddush cup.
* For next year, just buy a new kiddush cup, 5.5 oz.--using the 9 oz. cup makes it difficult to drink the right amount.
