### There notes are based on personal conversations with our Rabbi and are not necessarily applicable to everyone.  Do not treat this as halachic advise without first consulting your Rabbi.

## Plata
* If we put bread directly on it regularly, then clean and put away for pesach.
* If we occasionally or never put bread directly on it, then do Irui and cover with aluminum foil.  The aluminum foil won't break the plata.

## Pyrex
Untreifable like any other glass, but because it's baked, it's hard to make it visibly clean.  I would like to try putting them in an oven during self clean to see if that cleans them well, but I need to check what temperature pyrex can handle.

## Irui
Irui can be done once surfaces are visibly clean and have not been used with heat for 24 hours.  Our Rabbi pointed out that the reason for waiting 24 hours doesn't make sense for Irui (need further details here), so even though we are strict about it anyway, certainly the cleaning can take place at the end of the 24 hours right before doing Irui, and if one would like to be even more stringent, one can put soap in the water before Irui, creating an additional leniency for not waiting 24 hours.

## Dishwasher
After not using for 24 hours, run an empty cycle with soap.  In 5774, we started the cycle about 15 minutes before the latest time to own hametz, and then only used it as a drying rack all Pesach.  We considered washing our Pesach pots in it after Pesach (which my mother does), but decided not to for practical reasons--we wanted to dry them and put them away as quickly as possible, so we washed them by hand.
